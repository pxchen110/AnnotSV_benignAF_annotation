## How AnnotSV collect allele frequency data and set annotation threshold
### Database resources and input criteria

### Annotation threshold
1. 100% overlapping breakpoint: To ensure the annotated variants had similar biological function and impact,  
2. Allele frequency: Compare to pathogenic variants, benign variants may have higher allele frequency among population(tend to be common variant). AnnotSV defaultly settd annotation threshold to be 0.01, which means that if query SV can
